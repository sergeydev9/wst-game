# Whosaidtrue

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="450"></p>

## Initial Installation

This project requires the `nx` cli to be instlaled globally. This can be done by running `yarn global add @nrwl/cli`

## Applications

Each component is split into its own application. Applications are located in the `/apps` directory.

## Libraries

Anything potentially re-usable is placed in a library, and imported into applications. These are located in the `/libs` directory.

## Development server

Run `nx serve {my-app}` for a dev server (e.g. `nx serve api`)

## Dev HTTPS

In order for Stripe elements to be visible, the app must be served over HTTPS, even in local development.

To create and install local cert and key files, use `mkcert`. Here is a [link](https://geekflare.com/local-dev-environment-ssl/) to an article
that goes over the process. This will generate cert and key files that you can use for local dev for the domain you specified. Make sure to generate files
for localhost.

`.local.env` should contain two variables `DEV_SSL_KEY`, and `DEV_SSL_CERT`. The value of these variables must be an absolute path
to your local cert and key files generated by `mkcert`. DO NOT SHARE, OR INCLUDE THESE FILES IN ANY REPO.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## api

The api app requires a running database. Start up postgres by running `docker compose up`. Once the database is up and running, start the api server by running `nx serve api`.

### Envirnment Variables

The api reads from the following env variables:

- POSTGRES_DB
- POSTGRES_HOST
- POSTGRES_USER
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD
- JWT_SECRET
- NODE_ENV
- PORT
- POSTGRES_DB=whosaidtrue-dev
- POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
- POSTGRES_USER=root
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
- JWT_SECRET=mySecret
- NODE_ENV=development
- PORT=3000
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=test
- DOMAIN
- DATABASE_URL
- NX_API_BASEURL
- SG_API_KEY

These can be changed for local dev in `.local.env`

**warning** Values in `.local.env` must match values in `docker-compose.yml`

## Database

Documentation for the database can be found [here](apps/database/README.md)

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@whosaidtrue/mylib`.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
