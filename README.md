# Whosaidtrue

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="450"></p>

## Initial Installation

This project requires the `nx` cli to be instlaled globally. This can be done by running `yarn global add @nrwl/cli`

## Applications

Each component is split into its own application. Applications are located in the `/apps` directory.

## Libraries

Anything potentially re-usable is placed in a library, and imported into applications. These are located in the `/libs` directory.

## Development server

Run `nx serve {my-app}` for a dev server (e.g. `nx serve api`)

## Dev HTTPS

In order for Stripe elements to be visible, the app must be served over HTTPS, even in local development.

To create and install local cert and key files, use `mkcert`. Here is a [link](https://geekflare.com/local-dev-environment-ssl/) to an article
that goes over the process. This will generate cert and key files that you can use for local dev for the domain you specified. Make sure to generate files
for localhost.

`.local.env` should contain two variables `DEV_SSL_KEY`, and `DEV_SSL_CERT`. The value of these variables must be an absolute path
to your local cert and key files generated by `mkcert`. DO NOT SHARE, OR INCLUDE THESE FILES IN ANY REPO.

## Apple Pay

Apple Pay prevents use from unverified domains, even for local testing. In order to test Apple Pay, or make it available in production, follow the instructions detailed [here](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button)

## api

Documentation for the api can be found [here](apps/ap/README.md)

## Database

Documentation for the database can be found [here](apps/database/README.md)

## Redis

Both the socket server and the API use Redis

The docker compose file includes Redis Insight, an in browser redis management tool.

To access it, navigate to `localhost:8001`. There you will be asked to accept the EULA. Do so.
After accepting the EULA, you will be asked configure redis. Select the option to connect to a database using hostname and password.
There, you can enter the credentials for the Redis instance:

```shell
  Host: redis
  Port: 6379
  Name: wst (this can be whatever you want. It's only used to identify the DB in the Insight GUI)
  Username: (leave blank)
  Password: (leave blank)
```

when prompted.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@whosaidtrue/mylib`.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
